# Copy the Go module files and download dependencies separately to leverage Docker's caching
# Separate Dependency Installation:
   #  Copying go.mod and go.sum before the source code (COPY . .) allows Docker to cache the dependency download step, making future builds faster if dependencies donâ€™t change.


COPY go.mod go.sum ./
#go.sum contains checksums for each dependency, ensuring that the exact versions used are verified against these checksums to avoid tampering.
